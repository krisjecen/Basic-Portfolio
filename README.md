# Basic-Portfolio
Portfolio for week 1 homework

Here is my first brief bio site with About, Portfolio, and Contact pages.

In this assignment, I learned about:
-using relative and absolute positioning
-setting up nav links so they are positioned properly and don't roll under themselves (set a width for the element!)
-arranging text "on top of" images
-adding and adjusting borders
-a bit about footers but not quite to the perfect-sticky-footer level yet
-creating a header to be used across different pages
-assigning multiple classes to an element (just space them out after class=")
-creating divs to assign parenthood to elements for easier relative positioning
-...and a lot more, but I need to push this one last time and submit my homework link
