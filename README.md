# Basic-Portfolio
Portfolio for week 1 homework

Here is my first brief bio site with About, Portfolio, and Contact pages.

In this assignment, I learned about:
<li>-using relative and absolute positioning</li>
<li>-setting up nav links so they are positioned properly and don't roll under themselves (set a width for the element!)</li>
<li>-arranging text "on top of" images</li>
<li>-adding and adjusting borders</li>
<li>-a bit about footers but not quite to the perfect-sticky-footer level yet</li>
<li>-creating a header to be used across different pages</li>
<li>-assigning multiple classes to an element (just space them out after class=")</li>
<li>-creating divs to assign parenthood to elements for easier relative positioning</li>
<li>-...and a lot more, but I need to push this one last time and submit my homework link</li>
