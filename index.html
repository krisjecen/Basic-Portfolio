<!--This is my first homework assignment at UCBE-->
<!--The assignment is to make a page about myself, showing a picture of myself and a brief bio,-->
<!--a list of links to my portfolio (with placeholder links for now) and a contact page.-->
<!--I will outline the sections with comments below-->

            <p class="aboutme">Kris Jecen is basically a cat with an educational background in chemistry and some mechanical engineering. Equal parts analytical, artistic, and communicative, Kris is most at home when they can develop solutions that reduce suffering. Kris has lived in the Bay Area for eleven years and they are at an exciting transition point in their career: moving from the safety compliance field into web development and aiming to be involved in robotics later down the road.</p>
            <p class="aboutme">When they aren't practicing their coding skills, Kris likes to journal, draw, practice piano, pet neighborhood cats, and watch movie trailers. While they describe themselves as an introvert, Kris is very social and loves to hang out with friends as well as host parties and events at their apartment. They especially like creating space for meaningful discussions among their friends. Kris is also an runner! They've registered for Bay to Breakers 2019 and really need to train more in the hills before race day in May.</p>
